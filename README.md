# A. Andiron --- Collected Stories
* By A. Andiron

## How to read it:
* Available for purchase on Amazon kindle:

* Or, compile from this source code using pandoc.
	* (Or just read the markdown, available in source.) 

## Compilation notes:
* Compiled using pandoc-ebook-template. For instructions see:
	* https://github.com/evangoer/pandoc-ebook-template
* Note: pdf/latex version didn't compile last time I tried it, but I wasn't really trying to and it could easily be that I just don't have all the necessary latex dependencies installed.
