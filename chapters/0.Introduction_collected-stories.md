Every introduction to erotic must bein with the same question: why write erotica?

I initially began writing erotica for the same reason that I believe
most people do: as a way to build out, explore, and share some of my own
fantasies. A couple of the stories included in this collection were my
early attempts to do this. 
_Chinese Finger Trap_, _Handcuff knot_
I soon grew tired of my own fantasies though because I _know_ what I like, and
filling in a lot of details in fantasy did little to change anything in my
reality. So I started writing with the goal of building out _other people's_
fantasies instead. From conversations with friends and lovers, and friends who
I wished were lovers, I found inspiration to write a few stories that were
intended to appeal the to fantasies of very specific people. Among these
stories are: _La Capella_, _Listen to the Music_, _It's your birthday!_, and
_Spit Blood and Suck_.

Both writing for ones own fantasies and for those of others leaves the
author trying to create something that people think they _want_. And
the truth is what most people think they want is pretty conventional:
movie-character dialog, moving quickly to bland and realistic
descriptions of fucking, and fantasies that must include vampires.
Erotica ends up spinning endlessly in the same muddy rut, a hundred
million writers and readers all churning through billions of words, all
essentially describing the same thing. I have been in this churn myself!
I've watched my more conventional stories like _Take Off, Go Around_
soar in reads compared to something like _As If It isn't Even Difficult
to Do_, which I think is much more strongly written. There's nothing
wrong with erotica that does what you want. But don't you also wish that
sometimes erotica showed you something new?

I believe the truly exciting erotica is when the reader discovers
something they didn't even know they wanted. I found myself thinking
about how to push out the boundaries of what erotica could be. As in
any art, the only way to do this is to experiment. And as with any
experiment, it doesn't always work! I can't promise that every story
included here is a perfect gem. What I can promise is that every story
included here is in one way or another different (or at least trying to
be different) from erotica you've read before. _Arrival_ walks back and
forth across a gray line of consent. _Kraken_ isn't just a tentacle-sex
story, it's a _biological_ tentacle-sex story (as opposed to being based
in fantastical monsters). _Binding Off_ does have a fantastical
monster, but it might also be that the real monster is being obsessed
with one's hobby. And _How To Tie A Handcuff Knot_ is about falling in
love in an environment of purely physical carnal desires. Many of these
stories incorporate rich description and metaphor --- because if
there's one place left in our culture for over-the-top literary
language, it's gotta be erotica, don't you think?

Some of the stories might be offensive to some people. I think the
nature of experimenting is that sometimes this happens. _Spit Blood and Suck_ 
will make some people uncomfortable. But I encourage you to
be an experimental reader... so that I can be a more experimental
writer. Together, we might be able to bust erotica out of its rut!
