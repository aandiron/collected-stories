* These stories are experiments. Maybe all erotic stories are experiments, but these are intended to challenge the conventions of erotica. Conventions like:
	* bland language
	* fantasy that is derivative of vampire stories, etc
	* notions that one must remain in a safe space
	* centering on stories that the writer fantasizes about, instead of creating something interesting and new
	* These stories may not be _successful_ experiments, but it's important to know that I'm trying!
* These stories can sometimes be offensive --- Arrival walks back and forth across a gray line of consent. They are not for everyone.
	* Arrival wanders back and forth across a gray line of consent.  
* Some are very personal, about real people and real things that happened.
* Others are pure flights of fantasy.
* They all share a style of vivid description and careful literary construction.
* the odd experience that the stories I think are the best (marion date) often don't get as much attention as ones that I think are more typical and kinda weak (take off go around, chinese finger trap)
