# Spit Blood and Suck


_A warning: This story portrays graphic sexual violence, and does it without any kind of apology. This isn't a story of redemption, emotional evolution, or revenge. It is a pure, unadulterated violent fantasy, and the violence is exclusively against women. Why write this? Because breaking through forbidden barriers is fun. Sometimes it's hot. And because words can't hurt people. If you are sensitive about violence against women, you should not read this.  If you identify as male or feel you have dominant characteristics, you are not given consent to read this. Go watch the Sopranos instead.  But if you are among that minority of female-identifying and submissive people who are interested in exploring the very edgespace of their most violent fantasies, I hope this story helps you in your exploration._




They stepped out of the restaurant onto the crowded city sidewalk and
moved casually up the street, passing the slow-walkers and being
passed by the other folks with more pressing things to tend to.


"That was a lovely dinner, dear. Sushi is really just so transcendent
when it's good."

"Well, you're 'transcendent' in that white silk dress. I love how
flimsy it is, and the way it clings to every curve of your body
because the material is so light."

"Aww, you flatter. You know what Dolly Parton said: it costs a lot of
money to look this cheap."

"Yeah, _my_ money. I'll bet I could get a pretty penny for you on the
black market. Get back some of that dough you blew on that dress and
those shoes."

"Hee hee. I'll bet you could!" She winked at him.

They walked quietly for a moment, and passed a noisy corner bar with
about a hundred motorcycles parked in front. As they did he took her
elbow in his hand and gripped it somewhat firmly. He steered her up
close to a group of bikers. The biggest of them was standing talking to
his buddies, not facing the couple. In his hand the big biker held a
half-empty pitcher of beer. An entire pitcher. His hand was so big and
rough that it made the pitcher look proportionately like a normal pint
glass.

The man pulled the girl up behind the huge biker and poked him in the
shoulder.

"Hey man, you can have my woman for an hour. Do whatever you want with
her. $1000."

The biker turned around and stared at the couple. He was huge, well
over six feet but stocky and dense with muscle. He was dressed in
black leather, of course. Heavy boots with heels, pants of thick
leather with heavy-threaded stitching, and an armless leather vest
strapped around his torso that showed off the intricate inkwork that
ran up and down the length of his arms in spidery and indistinct
patterns. His long black hair was pulled back in a pony tail, held
with a thin leather strap, and his scraggly black beard was braided
into two viking braids that hung down on his chest.

The biker set his beer slowly down next to one of his buddies, and
reached for his wallet that was attached to his pants with a long chain.

"Alright... $1G." He said in a low, resonant voice, as he counted bills
from his wallet. "I hope you aren't joking buddy, because this kind of
thing I take very seriously.

She laughed, hoping she was playing along correctly, "Ha. Only $1000?
I'm worth more than that!"

"Shut up." The man said, twisting her arm. The woman had a sense that
maybe this wasn't strictly a game.

The bike handed a small wad of bills to the man.

"Nice." Said the man, "here's your bitch."

The woman started to try to back away, pulling against the grip on her
elbow. But the biker took her other arm and wrapping his fist around
her upper arm like it was a small stick, he yanked her from the man
with such force that she almost fell to her knees. She looked back
towards the man, with tears welling in her eyes, but he wasn't even
looking at her, he was turning to the bar to order a drink.

The biker dragged her quickly around the corner, so quickly she could
barely even process what might be happening. He pushed her down a dark
narrow alley, lined with overflowing and stinking trash cans,
the inter-woven shadowy lines of fire-escapes above them, and cement
stair wells that gave the buildings rear access to their basements.
There was very little light, and very little chance of anyone coming
down that alley at this time of night.

"what's your name honey?" The big biker asked.

"M..Mina." She stammered.

"Wrong. That was your name when you were with that loser back there who
just sold you to me. Now your name is Nether. Got that."

"Yes sir, I'm Nether." She said, figuring cooperation was the most
straight-forward way out of this terrifying situation.

"Good girl Nether. Now, get on your knees."

She hiked her dress up, not wanting to ruin it as she lowered her
knees onto the painfully gritty and foul-smelling pavement.

"Ah, shit. I drank so much beer back there, I have to take a leak.
Don't move Nether."

"Yes sir."

He unzipped his black leather pants, and pulled out a cock that was so
large that, even while limp, the end of it extended well beyond the
massive fist he gripped it with. The head of the thing mushroomed
disturbingly around the shaft. He took a step apart to set his feet in
his practiced stance, adjusted himself, and took aim.

When she realized what he was going to do she winced and closed her
eyes and turned her head. A hot stream of piss struck her square on
the belly and as it gained force it traveled up her body until it was
spilling hot and steaming onto her small perky tits.

All she could think about was how he was ruining her beautiful white
dress. Staining it with this foul umber that she would never be able to
clean out of it. This, this was the thing that made her truly hate him.

"Ahhhh. Thank god. I needed that."

She opened her eyes and looked at him, glaring.

"Yes sir. I'm sure you did. I'm glad you are relieved."

He reached into his vest and withdrew a knife. It had a six inch gold
blade, which looked small in his massive hand, but the blade was
attached to a menacing set of brass knuckles that he slipped over his
thick fingers.

"Now keep your eyes on me Nether! My dick's out, and I never draw my
dick out without using it. I'm going to put my dick in your mouth. You
are going to concentrate... and you are going to suck back your teeth. I
want you mouth to be a soft, wet hole. You can see my dick is big, but
that doesn't mean it's not sensitive. It's _very_ sensitive. Your mouth
should feel better on it that the tightest little virgin pussy it's
ever been my pleasure to stick it in. If I feel even the tiniest bit of
pressure, the smallest touch from those pebbles in your mouth, I'm going
to pull this knife across your throat so hard your head is going to flip
back like a pez dispenser. Then I'm going to stick my cock in your eye
socket and fuck your skull. Got it?"

"Y... Yes sir" she stammered again.

He put the blade up against her throat, and she could feel the edge
catching on her skin because it was so sharp. With his other hand he
put the head of his cock to her lips.

"Now... just the head first. Let's see if a stupid little rich bitch
like you can follow instructions."

She opened her lips, just a little, and very carefully keeping her teeth
out of the way, she dropped her jaw as she inched them around the
swelling head of his cock.

But she didn't calculate properly. She didn't account for the fact
that she had estimated how far to open her mouth while seeing his cock
flaccid. Now it was swelling, engorged with blood, getting bigger and
bigger in her mouth, far beyond her estimations. She kept trying to
open her mouth wider. She concentrated on keeping her teeth out of the
way, but it was swelling too fast. 


"Goddamn it you fucking stupid cunt!"

He pulled his dick from her mouth.

"I told you no fucking teeth! None!"

"Please sir! I'm sorry! I can do better, it was just a first-time
slip-up!" She was terrified, kneeling in the grit hurt her knees, and
her dress stuck against her body, the piss had turned cold and rancid.

His massive hand wrapped around her neck, and she could feel the
strength in his fingers as they went nearly entirely encompassed her
delicate neck. He lifted her slightly off her feet and stared into her
eyes and he smashed the brass knuckles into her mouth with the force
of a man who didn't know his own strength. 

She could feel her front teeth break off as the alley lit up white with
pain.

He leaned her head forward and blood poured from her mouth.

"Spit." He commanded.

She spat, and two or three broken teeth clattered on the concrete among
the blood and the piss.

"Now... again: suck! And this time it should be easier to keep your
teeth out of the way.

He rammed his dick back into her mouth and the pain overwhelmed her.
She just let her jaw go slack, her throat loose. He kept his hand
wrapped around her throat as he forced his cock over and over again
into the bloody hole that had been her mouth.

The pain made it seem like this went on for an immeasurable amount of
time. But it was not long before he got tired of fucking her face,
which had been so pretty, now made ugly with blood and tears and
smeared makeup. 

He lifted her up and leaned her over the railing of one of the
stairwells and used his knife to easily slit her dress wide up the back.
He touched her pussy and was pleased to find she was soaking wet.

"Ah my Nether! So you're enjoying this eh?"

"Yesh Sir, pleash keep being sho kind to me." she slurred through her
broken teeth.

"Is that fucking sass? You piss-covered piece of shit?"

The biker pushed his thobbing shaft into her pussy, splitting it wide
like a coconut dropped on pavement. He reached up and pushed her head
down so the railing dug into her chest. She watch drops of blood and
tears fall from her face and make a pattern of dots in the stairwell
below.

He fucked her with massive pounding strokes, growling and grunting and
huffing behind her like a raging bull or a prizefighter in a late
round.

He kept up a running commentary under his breath, laying out his
vision of a more perfect world.

"You fucking rich piece of shit. You cunting dog. I hate people like
you. The only thing you are good for is a place to shove my cock
into..."

He slid his hand down the front of her thigh, and lifted her leg
toward him, spreading her cunt wider so he could ram more of himself
into her. His hand slid down her calf and over her ankle and took her
expensive shoes with the long pointy heels and the red soles from her
foot. 

He stuck the point the heel up her ass.

"How do you like that you stupid twat? You like being fucked with your
expensive junk?"

He fucked her with both his dick and her shoe. Both stroked her with
pain, but different kinds. His cock was a huge, splitting pain, like
it was tearing her. Her shoe was a piercing pain, like it was being
stuck through her insides.

The biker pulled himself out of her, and grabbed her hair. He whipped
her head towards him and pulled it back, straining her neck so she was
looking up at the sky between the buildings above her. She could see
one star up there.

"Don't you dare close your eyes Nether."

He stroked his long shaft one or twice and cum poured out, filling her
eyes. It stung and burned but she didn't dare close her eyes.
She wouldn't have though it possible, but it felt to her like there
was so much cum that he filled up both her eye sockets like tea being
poured from a kettle into small china cups. And all she could see was
his foul stinking cum.

He stood and zipped his sticky, blood-covered cock back into his
leather pants.

"Come on. Walk bitch."

She stumbled along, once again being nearly dragged by this beast's
grip on her elbow. He walked her back around the corner to the bar and
tapped the map on the shoulder.

"Here's your woman back."

The man looked at her, blood running from her toothless maw, cum
smearing in long streaks from her eyes, her dress stained and stinking
and open, while she stood on one shoe.

"Forget it, she's no good to me now. You ruined her."

The biker grinned, grabbed her arm, and dragged her away with him.
