------------------------------------------------


The stories contained in this collection are intended to push the boundaries of
what turns you on outward.  They challenge both conventions of erotic writing
and good taste. They are not for everyone.

But for those who are looking for stories that break new ground instead of
rehashing all the tired cliches of erotica, and for those who like their
writing vivid and literary, A. Andiron's stories might be exactly what you are
looking for. Some of these stories dip into fantasy --- there are more than a
few monsters to be found here --- and the occasional fairy, but there are also
the very real challenges and rewards of navigating the tangled course of
interactions between people. A. Andiron takes you from the bottom of the sea,
to the darkest heart of the forest, to the skies above us.  



They are collected here for the first time from a wide variety of published
sources. As a bonus there are a few new, never-published-before stories
included as well.

Read them out loud to your lover in bed... and let them start worrying about what you might like. It'll put an element of novelty back in your love life! A nervous lover is a hot lover!
