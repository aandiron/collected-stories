# Erotica to Make Your Lover Wonder About You

Most people consider written erotica a "soft" form of pornography. But
what if the intimate and penetrating form of the written word were used
instead to push outwards the boundaries of what turns you on? What if
the text format could be used to tap directly into your most imaginative
erogenous zones? What if erotica were not soft, not safe? These are the
question that A. Andiron takes up in this collection of stories. They
challenge both conventions of erotic writing and good taste. They are
not for everyone.

They are for those who are looking for erotica that breaks new ground
instead of rehashing all the tired clich√©s, and for those who like their
writing vivid and literary. In them you will travel from the bottom of
the sea, to the darkest heart of the forest, to the skies above us,
searching for new ways to entice. Some stories dip into fantasy ---
there are more than a few monsters to be found here and the occasional
fairy --- but they also twist through the very real challenges and
rewards of navigating the tangled course of interactions between
humans.

The fourteen stories are collected here for the first time. Included are
all the stories previously published by A. Andiron on Amazon, as well
as stories from a wide variety of other publications. Two never-before
published stories are included as well.

Get this book. Curl up in bed. And read a story or two out loud to your
lover (or lovers!). And as you find yourself titillated by the weirdness
and the dirtiness, you can be sure: your lover will wonder about you!
