# Notes and To Dos for an A. Andiron anthology


## Cover
* The source included here will compile an epub with a flat-image cover. 
	* But Amazon automatically incorporates the tiff version of the cover with the epub, so the cover image in the epub from Amazon will be of the standing book.


## Story list and order: 
* Introduction
1. Kraken
2. Take Off, Go Around
3. As if it isn't even difficult to do
4. la cappella
5. Handcuff knot
6. The Ride Home
7. Tremble the Flowering Wood
8. It's your birthday!
9. A permanent sad fantasy
10. Chinese Finger Trap
11. spit blood and suck
12. Yarn Monster
13. Listen To The Music
14. Arrival

### Possible stories for a 2nd edition:
* With Interest
* [Unseen Horror]
* [Strangers]


## Things to do:
* [X] Go through all files and make sure title is entered as a # top level header
	* This is the only way to automatically get pagebreaks between each chapter.
* [X] Go through all the chapter files and make sure the emdashes are handled properly.
	* Copy the emdash character out of Tremble, that seems to work
	* the +smart extension added to the Makefile pandoc line should maybe handle --- for the emdash character? I prefer it that way.
* [X] Make sure story breaks in Tremble and elsewhere are working in epub
	* (You probably have to fix this in the published version of Tremble on Amazon as well.)
	* (seems like the +smart should handle this too)
* [X] Make sure the titles and the yaml at the top of each chapter file are behaving properly
